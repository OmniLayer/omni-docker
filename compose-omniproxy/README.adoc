= OmniProxy Docker Compose Configuration

== Quick Start (RegTest)

. Edit `sample.env`
. Make sure `OMICORE_TAG` and `BTCPROXY_TAG` set to correct and/or latest versions.
. `./run-compose.sh regtest`

== Mainnet and Testnet Status

Mainnet and Testnet configurations are not yet officialyl supported with Docker Compose. There
are a few things that need to be done:

1. Configure Docker directory "mounts" so blockchain data can be saved/reused
2. Improve `btcproxyd` so it can work with blockchain that is still syncing.
